## Kdd 2019 Reading list

paper name | have read | comment
---|--|--
A free energy based approach for distance metric learning | N
Adversarial Substructured Representation Learning for Mobile User Profiling | HY | Embedding user POI categories by graph and adversarial neural network; Not so related to my major but subgraph structure and POI categories are interesting
Beyond Personalization: Social Content Recommendation for Creator Equality and Consumer Satisfaction | N
Clustering without Over-Representation | N
Coupled Variational Recurrent Collaborative Filtering | N
DAML: Dual Attention Mutual Learning between Ratings and Reviews for Item Recommendation | N
Dual Sequential Prediction Models Linking Sequential Recommendation and Information Dissemination | Y | Good view of 'item-centered and user-centered;' Sampling unobserved interactions and using dual models(item-based and user-based model) to recgonize unobserved positive and unobserved negative samples; Experiments are well designed and organized; But embedding is linear and interpretability is not so solid; Expect, improvement of index is not so obvious. 
Dynamic Modeling and Forecasting of Time-evolving Data Streams | N 
Estimating Personalized Preferences Through Meta-Learning for User Cold-Start Recommendation | N
Gradient-based Hierarchical Clustering using Continuous Representations of Trees in Hyperbolic Space | Half-Y| Read abstract and introduction, using hyperbolic geometry; Not quite related to my research; But embedding space tree is a point worthing attention
Hidden POI Ranking with Spatial Crowdsourcing | Y | A good question, but not so interested in this topic. Article is a little hard to follow for me.
K-Multiple-Means: A Multiple-Means Clustering Method with Specified K Clusters | Y | great paper; Using Laplacian Rank and bipartite graph; One cluster can have multiple prototypes
Social Recommendation with Optimal Limited Attention | N
