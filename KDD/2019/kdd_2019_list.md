Gradient-based Hierarchical Clustering using Continuous Representations of Trees in Hyperbolic Space | Half-Y| Read abstract and introduction, using hyperbolic geometry; Not quite related to my research; But embedding space tree is a point worthing attention
Hidden POI Ranking with Spatial Crowdsourcing | Y | A good question, but not so interested in this topic. Article is a little hard to follow for me.
